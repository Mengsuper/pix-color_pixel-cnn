* There are four main networks included in the architecture

**pix_network_1.py**
1. Conditioning Network
We pretrain conditioning network on COCO image segmentation
2. Adaptation Network
Conditioning and adaptation network turn brightness channel Y into a set of features that are used for conditioning the PixelCNN.
3. Coloring Network(pixelCNN)
pixelCNN is optimized alongside conditioning and adaptation network. It predicts a low resolution chrominance of the image

**pix_network_2.py**
4. Refinement Network
The low resolution color image made from the previous network is fed into the refinement network, which then produces a full resolution colorization
